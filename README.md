## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

This is my #2 solution of this challenge. In #1 I used \<progress> tag to code the progress bar, this time I used \<div>s, and Sass. The storage information is also loaded from a JavaScript file, I think the data would come from some sort of a backend.

- #### Progress bar
  Using \<div>s it is much easier to style the progress bar and the white dot.

```html
<div class="progress-bar">
  <div id="progress-value" class="progress-value">
    <div class="dot"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- #### The progress value width
  I set the width of the progress value by updating a custom variable --width.

```js
const progressValue = document.getElementById("progress-value");
progressValue.setAttribute(
  "style",
  `--width: ${(used / availableStorage) * 100}%`
);
```

- #### Progress value animation
  This time I added an animation to the progress value. I used the --width custom variable again to specify the end of the animation

```css
@keyframes progress {
  0% {
    width: 1rem;
  }
  100% {
    width: var(--width, 0);
  }
}
```

- #### Reduced motion
  If user prefers reduced motion, I also added a rule disabling the animation. There is a nice article about in on web.dev blog.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .progress-value {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

- #### Link or button?
  I decided to code the buttons as buttons, not links as in #1 solution. I found a nice article on FreeCodeCamp. They could be assigned to appropriate action by JavaScript.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to code challenges pretending it is a part of a real website - as far as my current knowledge goes. Adding more problems and solve challenges in different ways helps me a lot. I would also like to focus on best practice, semantic HTML and accessibility.
